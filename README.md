# [Emoncms](http://github.com/emoncms/emoncms) frontend

This brief example illustrates the functioning of the emoncms menuv3 with its three layers, its articulation with the routing, the loading of the svg icons, the color schemes...

**Nota : the menuv3 uses jquery**

This site has been published with the [jekyll branch](https://github.com/alexandrecuer/frontend/tree/jekyll) in order to give a live demo. The code on the jekyll branch has been modified to run with a static website and the menu is build with a [data.json file](https://github.com/alexandrecuer/frontend/blob/jekyll/data.json)

The menuv3 is originally intended to run with a apache/php server : check the [master branch](https://github.com/alexandrecuer/frontend/tree/master) to see exactly how it is used within emoncms
